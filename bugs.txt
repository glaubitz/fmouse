FakeMouse Virtual Device Driver
BUGS

Feb., 10 2001

addition on Aug., 18 2002: Fix BUG01 and BUG07 ! they are easy to fix !

BUG01:

the driver is not compatible with Windows 95, because
it has been generated with Windows 98 DDK; normally
drivers SHOULD work under Windows 95 generated with
Windows 98 DDK, but the VDYNDEBD sample (MSDN Techart
# 4471) doesn't work either, so it's an issue with
the Windows 98 DDK
-> you simple need to specify the Windows version the
DDK shall create the driver for in vmm.h


The following two seem to be the last two bugs:
******************************************************************

BUG02:

Values don't seem to be applied by FMOUSE.VXD (from ESI)
	-> mouse jumps elsewhere
	-> could be also a bug in VMOUSE (Q139292), check
	the KB article if this bug has been resolved yet,
	otherwise use the circumvetion proposed by Microsoft
	or use Post_Pointer_Message instead

->fixed, the VMOUSE driver also does not have the bug anymore

BUG03:

MoveMouse always increments until target pointer position,
even when it needs to substract pointer position

->fixed

******************************************************************

BUG04:

DeviceIoControl always posts IoControlCode does not
post defined messages WM_MOVEMOUSE and WM_SETMOUSE
-> fixed, error was in debugtool.exe
   defined 0x0ffe instead 4094, 0x0fff instead 4095
	???

BUG05:

WM_MOVEMOUSE does not work correctly either, Post_...
is only called once - fixed (but not verified)->fixed

BUG06:

Sometimes the VxD cannot be loaded correctly anymore,
probably it does not remove itself from memory pro-
perly->look up DDK-sources for clean-up and exit
routine, system will need a power-off reboot with
the computer being turned off at least 1 min.
->Windows limitation

BUG07:

It would be nice if the VxD could determine the current
cursor position and store it into CurrentX and CurrentY,
so that when WM_MOVEMOUSE is sent the cursor is moved
relatively from its real current position.
