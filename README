This is a virtual device driver I wrote around 2001 to simulate
mouse movements by hooking the DeviceIoControl function of
the virtual mouse driver in Windows 9x.

It's a so-called miniport driver which are usually designed to
adapt the generic device class drivers in Windows to a specific
hardware.

The driver was written with the intent to control the movements
of the mouse pointer in Windows 9x from the application level
directly through a mouse driver allowing to feign any application
which tracks mouse movements into thinking that there is actually
someone sitting in front of the computer and moving the mouse.

Thus, the driver can be used to prevent to keep an activated screen
saver from kicking in - or - the purpose the driver was originally
written for - feigning desktop advertisment banners that someone
is actively surfing the web, see [1].
